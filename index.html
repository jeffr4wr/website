      <details>
        <summary>my pc
        </summary>
          <details><summary>CPU: 7700x</summary>
          <p>Ryzen 7 7700x
            <br>bought in japan
            <br>insane silicon lottery, running a stable -40 undervolt all cores
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>Cooler: PA140</summary>
          <p>Thermalright Peerless Assassin 140 Black
            <br>traded a 240mm aio at town hall bus stop for it
            <br>idk its a cooler. i put a 3d printed shroud on it to imrpove airflow
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>Motherboard: B650 MATX</summary>
          <p>Gigabyte B650M Aorus Elite AX (rev 1.1)
            <br>bought in japan
            <br>idk it works fine, been through a lot of cases, even dropped at one point lmfao
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>RAM: 4x16 (64GB total) DDR5</summary>
          <p>2x2x16 Corsair Vengeance DDR5 6000 CL30
            <br>one kit i traded my original 5200 cl40 for, other kit i got for $75 (yes genuinely)
            <br>as of xmas 2025 its worth ~1500 total. i really am the wolf of wall street
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>Storage: 1TB NVMe + 512GB HDD</summary>
          <p>1TB PNY CS2140 + 512GB Hitachi Travelstar Z7K500
            <br>nvme i bought in japan, hdd i got off a free pc in dee why, currently used to store recording of gd/phighting
            <br>so glad my case has a 2.5" drive slot that doesnt block airflow, w deepcool ❤️‍🩹
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>GPU: 6900 XT</summary>
          <p>Gigabyte Gaming OC Radeon RX 6900 XT
            <br>when i left home to go buy it it was 38 degrees outside. when i got off the bus at box hill 3 hours later it was fucking pouring with rain, and i walked 10 min through torrential rain to the sellers house. seller felt so bad seeing a kid in the rain that he gave me a ride back to tallawong lmfao
            <br>highkey a good cooler for the width, much better than my old asrock. fans spin up to 4000 rpm so that might be a factor
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>Case: 23L MATX (MFF)</summary>
          <p>Deepcool CH160 Plus (MATX)
            <br>goated case, bought new
            <br>it was between this or the jonsbo c6 max and i only got this bc the jonsbo was out of stock and im really not regretting that rn this case so peak
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>PSU: 80+ Gold 850W</summary>
          <p>XPG Core Reactor II 850W
            <br>chose this bc it was the best balance of cheap + good + small size (for case)
            <br>highkey great, no issues within like the year ive had it idk
          </p></details>
          <details><summary>Fans: 2x 120mm 4000RPM</summary>
          <p>Silverstone FHS 120X 
            <br>they are strapped onto my cpu cooler (getting these was cheaper than a 240mm aio)
            <br>chose because theyre dirt cheap and have insane pressure + airflow (loud tho!)
          </p></details>
